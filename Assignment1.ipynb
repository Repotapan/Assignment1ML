The model is trained by adjusting its parameters to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output on the training data.

Anomaly detection is the process of identifying rare events or patterns that do not conform to the expected behavior of the system. It is an important application of unsupervised learning since it is often difficult to obtain labeled data for anomalies, as they are rare and unpredictable.\n",

    "One approach to anomaly detection using unsupervised learning is to use clustering algorithms to group similar data points together and identify outliers that do not belong to any cluster. This is called density-based clustering, where the density of the data points is used to identify clusters and detect anomalies. For example, DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a popular density-based clustering algorithm that can identify clusters of varying shapes and sizes, including noise points that do not belong to any cluster."
